## Full Stack App
 - A touch-based app that checks our current location and determines the target, and if a user touches or clicks repeatedly on first color then the device compares the current location coordinates with the target and tells the user whether they are inside the treasure location or not.
 - If a user touches or clicks the first color of app then it provides a valid treasure location.
 - If a user is away from target location then, User will hear information to help me and see the clue to find the trasure location.
 - Finally, when user reaches the destination then the user will hear and see the confirmation of reaching the treasure location.
